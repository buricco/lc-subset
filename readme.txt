These are rewrites of various utilities I've found on Linux, BSD and Unix
systems.

With the exception of signames.c/h (in the "kill" folder) and setmode.c (in
the "mkdir" folder) - which come from the BSDs - the rest of the code is
ground-up rewrites.

Obviously BSD code is under the BSD license.  This is the sole exception to
the license terms found in license.txt.
