These are rewrites of various utilities I've found on Linux, BSD and Unix
systems.

With the exception of signames.c/h (in the "kill" folder) and setmode.c (in
the "mkdir" folder) - which come from the BSDs - the rest of the code is
ground-up rewrites.  The goal is for them to be lightweight and to Do The
Right Thing, whatever that may be.  I do accept submissions via the github
page.

The default license for all code not otherwise specified is the UIUC or NCSA
license.  The exceptions are some library functions borrowed from the BSDs.
Obviously BSD code is under the BSD license.
